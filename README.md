A Manchester encoder visualizer typically shows the encoded signal for a given input data stream using Manchester encoding. In Manchester encoding, each bit of data is represented by two level transitions. A logical "1" is represented by a high-to-low transition, and a logical "0" is represented by a low-to-high transition within each bit period.
